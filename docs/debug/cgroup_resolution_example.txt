Step-by-Step Example: Resolving CGroup ID to Container Info

Scenario:
- A process (PID 100) is running inside a Docker container.
- The BPF tool detects an event (e.g., file open) and reports:
  "pid=100 cgroup_id=4026531840"

Step 1: BPF Event Reception
The Python script receives the line. It knows the numeric ID (4026531840) but doesn't know it's "Docker container X".

Step 2: Look up Candidate Paths
The script checks the process involved (PID 100).
It reads the file: /proc/100/cgroup

Content of /proc/100/cgroup:
0::/docker/a1b2c3d4e5f6...

The script extracts the path candidate: "/docker/a1b2c3d4e5f6..."

Step 3: Verification (The "Compare" Step)
The script constructs the full filesystem path to the cgroup:
Path: /sys/fs/cgroup/docker/a1b2c3d4e5f6...

It runs `os.stat()` on this path to get the inode number (st_ino).
Result: st_ino = 4026531840

Step 4: Match Confirmation
The script compares the inode from disk (4026531840) with the ID from BPF (4026531840).
They match!

Step 5: Extraction
Now that we are sure this path is correct, we parse the string "/docker/a1b2c3d4e5f6...".
We extract the Container ID: "a1b2c3d4e5f6..."

Step 6: Metadata Lookup
We run `docker inspect a1b2c3d4e5f6...` to get the image name and container name.
